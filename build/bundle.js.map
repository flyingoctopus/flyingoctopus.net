Defaults to ImitateBrowserBehavior\n\t *                    when the DOM is available, null otherwise\n\t * - onError          A function that is used to handle errors\n\t * - onAbort          A function that is used to handle aborted transitions\n\t *\n\t * When rendering in a server-side environment, the location should simply\n\t * be the URL path that was used in the request, including the query string.\n\t */\n\tfunction createRouter(options) {\n\t  options = options || {};\n\t\n\t  if (isReactChildren(options)) options = { routes: options };\n\t\n\t  var mountedComponents = [];\n\t  var location = options.location || DEFAULT_LOCATION;\n\t  var scrollBehavior = options.scrollBehavior || DEFAULT_SCROLL_BEHAVIOR;\n\t  var state = {};\n\t  var nextState = {};\n\t  var pendingTransition = null;\n\t  var dispatchHandler = null;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof location === 'string') location = new StaticLocation(location);\n\t\n\t  if (location instanceof StaticLocation) {\n\t    warning(!canUseDOM || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test', 'You should not use a static location in a DOM environment because ' + 'the router will not be kept in sync with the current URL');\n\t  } else {\n\t    invariant(canUseDOM || location.needsDOM === false, 'You cannot use %s without a DOM', location);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // Automatically fall back to full page refreshes in\n\t  // browsers that don't support the HTML history API.\n\t  if (location === HistoryLocation && !supportsHistory()) location = RefreshLocation;\n\t\n\t  var Router = React.createClass({\n\t\n\t    displayName: 'Router',\n\t\n\t    statics: {\n\t\n\t      isRunning: false,\n\t\n\t      cancelPendingTransition: function cancelPendingTransition() {\n\t        if (pendingTransition) {\n\t          pendingTransition.cancel();\n\t          pendingTransition = null;\n\t        }\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      clearAllRoutes: function clearAllRoutes() {\n\t        Router.cancelPendingTransition();\n\t        Router.namedRoutes = {};\n\t        Router.routes = [];\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Adds routes to this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n\t       */\n\t      addRoutes: function addRoutes(routes) {\n\t        if (isReactChildren(routes)) routes = createRoutesFromReactChildren(routes);\n\t\n\t        addRoutesToNamedRoutes(routes, Router.namedRoutes);\n\t\n\t        Router.routes.push.apply(Router.routes, routes);\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Replaces routes of this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n\t       */\n\t      replaceRoutes: function replaceRoutes(routes) {\n\t        Router.clearAllRoutes();\n\t        Router.addRoutes(routes);\n\t        Router.refresh();\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Performs a match of the given path against this router and returns an object\n\t       * with the { routes, params, pathname, query } that match.
