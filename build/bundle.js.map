Defaults to ImitateBrowserBehavior\n *                    when the DOM is available, null otherwise\n * - onError          A function that is used to handle errors\n * - onAbort          A function that is used to handle aborted transitions\n *\n * When rendering in a server-side environment, the location should simply\n * be the URL path that was used in the request, including the query string.\n */\nfunction createRouter(options) {\n  options = options || {};\n\n  if (isReactChildren(options)) options = { routes: options };\n\n  var mountedComponents = [];\n  var location = options.location || DEFAULT_LOCATION;\n  var scrollBehavior = options.scrollBehavior || DEFAULT_SCROLL_BEHAVIOR;\n  var state = {};\n  var nextState = {};\n  var pendingTransition = null;\n  var dispatchHandler = null;\n\n  if (typeof location === 'string') location = new StaticLocation(location);\n\n  if (location instanceof StaticLocation) {\n    warning(!canUseDOM || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test', 'You should not use a static location in a DOM environment because ' + 'the router will not be kept in sync with the current URL');\n  } else {\n    invariant(canUseDOM || location.needsDOM === false, 'You cannot use %s without a DOM', location);\n  }\n\n  // Automatically fall back to full page refreshes in\n  // browsers that don't support the HTML history API.\n  if (location === HistoryLocation && !supportsHistory()) location = RefreshLocation;\n\n  var Router = React.createClass({\n\n    displayName: 'Router',\n\n    statics: {\n\n      isRunning: false,\n\n      cancelPendingTransition: function cancelPendingTransition() {\n        if (pendingTransition) {\n          pendingTransition.cancel();\n          pendingTransition = null;\n        }\n      },\n\n      clearAllRoutes: function clearAllRoutes() {\n        Router.cancelPendingTransition();\n        Router.namedRoutes = {};\n        Router.routes = [];\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Adds routes to this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n       */\n      addRoutes: function addRoutes(routes) {\n        if (isReactChildren(routes)) routes = createRoutesFromReactChildren(routes);\n\n        addRoutesToNamedRoutes(routes, Router.namedRoutes);\n\n        Router.routes.push.apply(Router.routes, routes);\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Replaces routes of this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n       */\n      replaceRoutes: function replaceRoutes(routes) {\n        Router.clearAllRoutes();\n        Router.addRoutes(routes);\n        Router.refresh();\n      },\n\n      /**\n       * Performs a match of the given path against this router and returns an object\n       * with the { routes, params, pathname, query } that match.
